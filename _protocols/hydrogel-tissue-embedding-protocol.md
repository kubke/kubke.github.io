1. Prepare the HM solution.  
   a) Refer to the [HM solution recipe](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hm-solution-recipe.md).  
   b) Keep the HM solution and all ingredients used to prepare it, on ice - during preparation, storage and when in use.  
   c) Preparation is not time consuming, so these reagents can be prepared on the day before use - or can be prepared earlier than this, and stored at -20°C (HM solution), or 4°C (PFA and PBS).  
   d) Before starting the tissue embedding, make sure that there is no precipitation floating in the HM solution; this is an indicator of spontaneous polymerization of the stored monomer solution.  

2. Dissect a chick embryo and label the cranial nerve ganglia with DiI.

3. Incubate the labelled embryo overnight at 37°C in 3ml 1x PBS to allow the DiI to travel the length of the neurons.

4. Take the chick embryo (with DiI labelled) and incubate in 3ml ice-cold 1× PBS for 4 days.

Note: Carry out steps 5 - 9 in a fume hood, as the HM solution is toxic.

5. Thaw the pre-prepared HM solution on ice or in the fridge (4°C). Gently mix the thawed monomer solution by inverting. Place the embryo in 1ml of HM solution in an eppendorf tube. Incubate the embryo at 4°C for 4 days (on a rocker to provide gentle shaking).

6. To remove oxygen from the sample, place the eppendorf tube in a small beaker (containing ice) in a desiccation chamber. Partially open the cap of the tube to allow gas exchange.

7. Turn on the nitrogen flow to fill the desiccation chamber with nitrogen gas. Turn off the nitrogen flow when the lid of the chamber moves easily (should take ~4 seconds for this to occur).

8. Use the following protocol to remove oxygen from the chamber and replace with nitrogen gas. 1 minute vacuum, ~4 seconds nitrogen (or until desiccation chamber lid moves easily), and repeat this for a total of 10 times.

9. Open the chamber just enough to reach the tube, and then close the lid while continuously purging with nitrogen gas. This is to remove all the oxygen (because oxygen inhibits hydrogel polymerization, so we want to remove as much oxygen as possible).

10. Put the closed eppendorf tube into the incubator at 37 °C until it has polymerised.  

Note: Gentle shaking helps in heat transfer for achieving robust and uniform polymerization, but is not necessary for successful polymerisation.  

Troubleshooting: If hydrogel does not polymerise, repeat the degassing step and transfer the tube to 37 °C again. Note that lower acrylamide concentration (such as 0.5% (wt/vol)) hydrogels do not solidify fully upon polymerization. Therefore, the degassing step is especially crucial.
 
11. Once polymerisation has occurred, carefully cut off the end of the tube, and push the gel out onto a petri dish. Store at room temperature.
