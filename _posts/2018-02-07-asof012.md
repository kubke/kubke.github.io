# Embryo asof012

The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of using a lower concentration HM solution to embed an embryo.

Embryo "asof012". Stage 26 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 25/01/18 and was completed on 05/02/18. The result of this experiment was that mfk and asof decided to continue not to use the SOFT GEL unless absolutely necessary, due to the difficulty in mounting it.

25/01/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac from the embryo. Asof then staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof012 staging features:

- 2 toes are distinct in the toe plate (25-26)
- A shadow could be seen between two digits in the digital plate (26)
- The shape of the digital plate was not so rounded as a 26 (25)
- Overall appearance of maxillary process (26)
- Overall appearance of "e" and "f" (27)

Overall, the embryo was put at a stage 26 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the following ganglia:
- V (both sides)
- VII (both sides)
- VIII (both sides)
- X (both sides)

These ganglia may have been incorrectly identified, as mfk did not check them. 

Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia and incubated the embryo in PBS at 37°C overnight.

Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI was mixed somewhat with another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.

26/01/18

Asof checked asof012 using the fluorescence microscope to see whether the label had travelled along the neurons of the trigeminal nerve. Asof found that the dye had not travelled. The embryo was nevertheless placed into ice cold ![HM solution (SOFT GEL)](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hm-solution-(soft-gel)-recipe.md) and kept at 4°C for 4 days with gentle shaking.

30/01/18

Asof de-gassed the tube according to the ![Hydrogel tissue embedding protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hydrogel-tissue-embedding-protocol.md) and asof012 was put into the incubator at 37°C to polymerise the HM solution.

02/02/18

The solution was deemed to have polymerised, and was removed from the eppendorf tube. The gel containing asof012 was placed into 30% sucrose solution for 3 days. One drop of sodium azide was added to the sucrose solution to prevent bacterial growth.

05/02/18

Asof took the gel containing asof012 out of the sucrose solution, and placed it onto a blob of OCT on the block of a sliding microtome. The gel and tissue was frozen at -29°C. Slices were cut, first at 70um, then 50um, 45um, 40um and 35um. They were placed into wells containing PBS. 

Asof tried to mount a few of the 70um and 50um slices onto glass slides, mounting in deionized water containing a drop of Triton X100. However, the gel was found to be quite sticky and stretchy, and there were a number of problems with mounting it. The embryo and the few mounted slides were disposed of on 05/02/18, and mfk and asof decided to continue not to use the SOFT GEL unless absolutely necessary, due to the difficulty in mounting it.
