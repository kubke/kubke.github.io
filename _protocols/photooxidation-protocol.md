# Photo-oxidation protocol

Sourced from [Photoconversion of diaminobenzidine with different fluorescent neuronal markers into a light and electron microscopic dense reaction product](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezproxy.auckland.ac.nz/doi/10.1002/jemt.1070240103/epdf), written with reference to the section 'Photoconversion of the Carbocyanide Dyes DiI and DiO: Application for Light Microscopy'.

Ref: Lübke J (1993) Photoconversion of diaminobenzidine with different fluorescent neuronal markers into a light and electron microscopic dense reaction product. Microscopy Research and Technique 24:2-14. 


1. Prepare reagents.  
   a) Refer to the reagent list.  
   b) Preparation is not time consuming, so these reagents can be prepared on the day before use - or can be prepared earlier than this and stored at 2-8°C (DAB solution) and 4°C (Tris-HCl buffer), as they are stable.  

2. Dissect a chick embryo and label the ganglia with DiI.

3. Incubate the labelled embryo overnight in 3ml 1x PBS at 37°C to allow the DiI to travel the length of the neurons.

4. Pre-incubate embryo in a glass dish in 3ml of 1.5-2 mg/ml DAB-100 mM Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH 7.6, kept on ice), for 4 days.

5. Remove the DAB-Tris-HCl solution, and immerse embryo in a fresh, ice-cold DAB-Tris-HCl solution (3ml).

6. Use a fluorescence microscope to observe the photo-oxidation reaction happening in the embryo in the dish (x 10, x 16, x 25, or x 40 Neofluar fluorescence objectives (Zeiss or Nikon) using a rhodamine excitation filter combination (Zeiss BP 546 mm, FT 580 nm, LP 590 nm, or Leitz filter combination N2; and a 100-200 W mercury lamp – what the authors of the article used). Observe until all fluorescence fades and a brownish DAB reaction product forms.

7. While watching the reaction, replace the incubation solution with a freshly prepared DAB-Tris-HCl solution (3ml, kept on ice) roughly every 15 minutes.

8. Once photoconversion has finished, rinse the embryo several times with 3ml of 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6). Each rinse should last around 60 minutes.
