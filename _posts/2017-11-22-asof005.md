# Embryo asof005 dissection

The aim of this work was for me to practice techniques involved in the staining of an embryo.

Embryo "asof005". Stage 26 (unconfirmed). Work on this embryo began on 27/09/2017, and was completed on 28/09/2017. In this embryo I practiced trying to inject an embryo I had dissected, to try and get the stain to take up, but could not get the staining to work.


27/09/2017 (Week 8 Wednesday)

I removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with PBS. I removed the amniotic sac from the embryo.
I then staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof005 staging features:

- 1 faint groove present on the toe plate, separating 3rd toe from the rest ~early 25?
- Bill smooth and rounded, no outpouching of the beak ~25
- Pharyngeal arches similar in shape to H&H ~26?
- Diameter of eye closer in length to forebrain than midbrain (smaller in length than midbrain)
- Elbow joint distinct, no demarcation of digits - 25
- Toe plate becoming more pointy, less rounded, even though cannot see any demarcation of digits ~26

Overall, asof put the embryo at stage 26. MFK unavailable so this staging is unconfirmed.

Asof dissected the embryo to expose the following ganglia, all on both sides:
- V
- VII
- IX

MFK and asof decided the purpose of this embryo should be to try and inject only the trigeminals without contaminating anything. The trigeminal ganglia were chosen because they were undamaged, and large- so easy to inject. Asof injected both trigeminals with standard DiI using pressure injection with methanol. There was no obvious contamination at the time, although some was discovered after incubation. Asof put embryo asof005 in the incubator at 37.5 degrees C overnight.

Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI was mixed somewhat with another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


28/09/2017 (Week 8 Thursday)

Asof began clearing the embryo. Some contamination from the dye was found on the hindbrain, on the caudal, right hand side (embryo p.o.v.), below IX ganglion. Asof put the embryo through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md).

However, when observed under a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), asof and MFK saw that labelling had not worked, and we didn’t know why, because MFK had not checked asof’s injection. Therefore, embryo asof005 was disposed of.
