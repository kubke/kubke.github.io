# Embryo asof008

The aim of this work was to see if the dye would travel along the neurons (and remain visible) when an embryo was embedded in HM solution and the solution was then polymerised.

Embryo "asof008". Stage 26. Work with this embryo began on 08/01/18, and was completed on ???????????/01/18. DID THE DYE TRAVEL/HOLD?


08/01/18

I removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with PBS. I removed the amniotic sac from the embryo. I then staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof008 staging features:

- digital plate was rounded (26)
- no toes/digits obviously demarcated (25?)
- maxillary process has two bumps (26)
- no evidence of bill (<27)
- pharyngeal arches overall appearance (26)

Overall, the embryo was put at a stage 26. Mfk checked and confirmed.


Asof dissected until the following ganglia were exposed (embryo p.o.v.):
- VII (both sides)
- IX (both sides)
- V (both sides)

These ganglia may not have been correctly identified, since they were unconfirmed by mfk. In particular, the trigeminal ganglia may not have been correctly identified. Both trigeminal ganglia were badly damaged (the ganglion on the left (embryo's pov) was almost completely gone/destroyed).

Asof then practiced labelling all of the above ganglia with red DiI pressure injection with methanol. Instead of putting into the 37°C incubator overnight, the embryo was placed into ice cold ![HM solution (STIFF GEL)](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hm-solution-recipe.md) and kept in the cold room (4°C) for 4 days. The tube was gently shaken for the duration of the 4 days in HM solution.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI was mixed somewhat with another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.

Asof de-gassed the tube according to the ![Hydrogel tissue embedding protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hydrogel-tissue-embedding-protocol.md) and put embryo asof008 into the incubator at 37°C. 


15/01/18

The HM gel had polymerised when the tube was checked in the morning. This was tested by inverting the tube, and seeing that the gel did not move.

Mfk and asof cut asof008 with the sledge microtome (which has a freezing attachment). The embryo with
