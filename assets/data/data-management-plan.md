## ETHICS AND PRIVACY

Requirements | Details
------------  | ------------ 
Ethics requirements | [Yes/ No, not applicable.] [If yes (human or animal) provide details of Ethics submission and ID.] 
How will you manage any ethical issues? | [If yes, above, consider: Have you gained consent for data preservation and sharing/publishing? How will you protect the identity of participants if required? How will sensitive data be handled to ensure it is stored and transferred securely? Ethical issues affect how you store data, who can see/use it, how it can be used and how long it is kept. Managing ethical concerns may include: anonymisation of data; referral to departmental or institutional ethics committees; and formal consent agreements. You should show that you are aware of any issues and have planned accordingly. If you are carrying out research involving human participants, you must also ensure that consent is requested to allow data to be shared and reused in as broad a terms as possible.].
Are there other privacy and/or security requirements? | [Yes / No, not applicable.] [If yes, describe any data privacy/ security measures that need to be implemented related to the project data e.g. de-identifying (data cleansing), encryption on disk, encrypted communication links, disconnected from the internet, secure physical storage, no copies permitted. Consider: What are the risks to data security and how they will be managed? How will access be controlled? Are there formal standards to comply with?]

## DATA ORGANISATION

### DATA COLLECTION/CREATION

Data Collectionn/Creation | Description
------------  | ------------ 
What data will you create/collect? | *[Consider: What type, format and volume of data? Do your chosen formats and software enable sharing and long-term access to the data? - Are there any existing data that you can reuse? Give a brief description of the data, including any existing data or third-party sources that will be used, in each case noting its content, type and coverage. Outline and justify your choice of format and consider the implications of data format and data volumes in terms of storage, backup and access.] Data description: / Data type: / Format and why: / Compatible formats for long-term access/sharing: YES/NO /Are there Existing data:*
How will the data be collected/ created? | *[Consider: What standards or methodologies will you use? What quality assurance processes will you adopt? Outline how the data will be collected/created and which community data standards (if any) will be used. This may include processes such as calibration, repeat samples or measurements, standardised data capture or recording, data entry validation, peer review of data or representation with controlled vocabularies.] *
What non-digital data/assets will you create/ collect? | *[Consider: Digitisation or recording(e.g. photographing, transcribing) of any data or materials originally created/ collected in non-digital forms (e.g. original surveys, interviews). Where will non-digital data assets be stored?]*

### File Management 

How will the data be organised? | *[Consider how the data will be organised during the project, mentioning for example file and folder naming conventions, version control, folder structures, use of database – schema, tables and relationships.]*
------------  | ------------ 

### Storage locations 

How will the data be stored and backed up during the research?| *[Consider:  Do you have sufficient storage or will you need to request additional services? Where do you intend to store your data? How will the data be backed up? Who will be responsible for backup and recovery? How will the data be recovered in the event of an incident? Describe the primary location of your data. State how often the data will be backed up and to which locations. How many copies are being made? Storing data on laptops, computer hard drives or external storage devices alone is very risky. The use of robust, managed storage provided by the University is preferable. Similarly, it is normally better to use automatic backup services provided by ITS Services than rely on manual processes. If you choose to use a third-party service, you should ensure that this does not conflict with any funder, institutional, departmental or group policies, for example in terms of the legal jurisdiction in which data are held or the protection of sensitive data.]*
------------  | ------------ 

## METADATA AND DOCUMENTATION


Item | Description
------------  | ------------ 
What documentation and metadata will accompany the data to support its discovery, (re)use and increase impact? | *[Consider:  What information is needed for the data to be to be read and interpreted in the future? How will you capture / create this documentation and metadata? What metadata standards will you use and why? / Describe the types of documentation that will accompany the data to help secondary users to understand and reuse it. This should at least include basic details that will help people to find the data, including who created or contributed to the data, its title, date of creation and under what conditions it can be accessed. / Documentation may also include details on the methodology used, analytical and procedural information, definitions of variables, vocabularies, units of measurement, any assumptions made, and the format and file type of the data. Consider how you will capture this information and where it will be recorded. Wherever possible you should identify and use existing community standards. ]*
Spatial extent | *[If applicable, state the spatial or geographic extent of your data with places names AND coordinates (N: E: S: W:) to enable bounding box / spatial searching.]*
Temporal extent | *[If applicable, state the period(s) of time over which your data is associated.]*
Links | *[Links to files (e.g. DMP, README.txt, geospatial (.kml), etc.) to be published as a metadata package to accompany data publication and facilitate data use.]*

## OWNERSHIP, COPYRIGHT & IP

The copyright and other IP is owned/held by: | (indicate)
------------  | ------------ 
The University of Auckland (normal situation for research undertaken by university staff) | *INDICATE*
The student (research by research student in the normal course of study, which does not fall into any of the other categories.)| *INDICATE*
Joint ownership (research conducted in collaboration: copyright and IP ownership are documented in an agreement between the organisations) | *INDICATE*
Third party data (data owned by third party or generated under UniServices agreements. | *INDICATE*

## ACTIVE DATA - SHARING & ACCESS CONTROL

ISSUES | DESCRIPTION
------------  | ------------ 
Access to the data during the project will be: | *[Unrestricted / Restricted/ Embargoed – delete as necessary.] / [If embargoed, provide details and date for release.]*
How will you manage access and security? | *[Consider: Whether you are the only person that will have access to the active, unpublished data, or data will be shared internally (specify with who) /externally (specify with who)? What are the risks to data security and how will these be managed? How will you control access to keep the data secure? How will you ensure that collaborators can access your data securely? If creating or collecting data in the field how will you ensure its safe transfer into your main secured systems? / If your data is confidential (e.g. personal data not already in the public domain, confidential information or trade secrets), you should outline any appropriate security measures and note any formal standards that you will comply with e.g. ISO 27001.]*

## RETENTION & DISPOSAL

Data must be retained after submission of thesis or publication of results for a minimum of: | (SELECT)
------------  | ------------ 
6 years (standard minimum retention after last publication based on data) | 
10 years (for medical research involving clinical trials from the end of the trial) | 
Until patient reaches 26 years of age, and at least 10 after last treatment (for clinical research involving children) | 
21 years from the date of filing a patent related to this research | 
Other specified time | 
Based on the above, data must be kept until at least | *[DD/MM/YYYY]*

## DATA PUBLISHING AND DISCOVERY

ISSUE | DESCRIPTION 
------------  | ------------ 
Licencing | *[State licence(s) under which you plan to make the data publically accessible. Be as open as possible. Creative Commons Aotearoa New Zealand – Licences explained ]*
Outline how data will be prepared and where it will be published. | *[Consider: How will potential users find out about your data? With whom will you share the data, and under what conditions? Will you share data via the University Data Publishing and Discovery Service or a disciplinary data repository (listing)? Will you publish a metadata only file with the institutional repository? Will you handle requests directly or use another mechanism? When will you make the data available? Will you pursue getting a persistent identifier for your data? / The methods used to share data will be dependent on a number of factors such as the type, size, complexity and sensitivity of data. If possible, mention earlier examples to show a track record of effective data sharing.]*

## LONG-TERM ARCHIVE / PRESERVATION (20+years, if applicable)

ISSUE | DESCRIPTION
------------  | ------------ 
What is the long-term preservation plan for the dataset? |*[Publishing with DOI should offer persistent access over years, not necessarily decades. Nor does a DOI actively address any needs to transform or migrate data from obsolete formats over time. Consider: Does your data offer something irreplaceable (actually or practically) that is of value to society over decades to come? If unsure, please contact the Library. / Provide information or guidance on how datasets that have long-term value will be preserved and curated beyond the lifetime of the project. Indicate likely areas of risk (i.e. proprietary formats). If you do not propose to use an established repository, the data management plan should demonstrate that resources and systems will be in place to enable the data to be curated effectively beyond the lifetime of the project. Document any discussion of long–term archive with academic units or other relevant staff.]*

## RDM/DMP RESPONSIBILITIES & RESOURCES


ISSUE | DESCRIPTION
------------  | ------------ 
Who will be responsible for data management? | *[If your project has several contributors and/or institutions, and/or the ownership is complex, consider: Who is responsible for implementing the DMP, and ensuring it is reviewed and revised? Who will be responsible for each data management activity? How will responsibilities be split across partner sites in collaborative research projects? Will data ownership and responsibilities for research data management be part of any consortium agreement or contract agreed between partners? / Outline the roles and responsibilities for all activities e.g. data capture, metadata production, data quality, storage and backup, data archiving & data sharing. Consider who will be responsible for ensuring relevant policies are respected. Individuals should be named where possible.]*
What resources will you require to deliver your plan? | *[Consider: Contacting the Centre for eResearch. Is additional specialist expertise (or training for existing staff) required? Do you require hardware or software which is additional or exceptional to existing institutional provision? Will charges be applied by data repositories? / Carefully consider any resources needed to deliver the plan, e.g. software, hardware, technical expertise, etc. Where dedicated resources are needed, these should be outlined and justified.]*
