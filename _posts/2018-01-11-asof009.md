# Embryo asof009

The aim of this work was for asof to practice dissecting an embryo to maintain the skills necessary for dissection. This embryo was also used to see the effect of embedding in HM solution for 5 days, rather than 4.

Embryo "asof009". Stage 25 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 09/01/18, and was completed on ???????????/01/18.

09/01/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac from the embryo. Asof then staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof009 staging features:

- Overall appearance of pharyngeal arches (25)
- Pointy edge of protuberance "e" is present (25)
- Overall appearance of wing/leg buds (25)
- Elbow joint distinct (25)

Overall, the embryo was put at a stage 25. Unconfirmed by mfk.

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected until trigeminal ganglia were exposed on both sides of embryo. Other ganglia may also have been exposed, but embryo asof009 was not checked by mfk.

Asof then practiced labelling all of the above ganglia with red DiI pressure injection with methanol. Instead of putting into the 37°C incubator overnight, the embryo was placed into ice cold ![HM solution (STIFF GEL)](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hm-solution-recipe.md) and kept at 4°C for 5 days. The tube was gently shaken for the duration of the 5 days in HM solution. 5 days was used rather than 4, to test the effect of longer period of time in the cold HM solution.

Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI was mixed somewhat with another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.

Asof de-gassed the tube according to the ![Hydrogel tissue embedding protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hydrogel-tissue-embedding-protocol.md) and put asof009 into the incubator at 37°C. The solution polymerised, and was left in the incubator for a few days before storing at room temperature.
