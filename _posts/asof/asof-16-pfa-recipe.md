# 16% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution recipe

To make 10ml of 16% PFA:
* Add 1.6g PFA to 8ml distilled water
* Heat to 60°C
* Add 1-2 drops of 1 n NaOH, as PFA requires the solution to have a basic pH before it will dissolve.
* Add distilled water to make the solution up to 10ml

Storage: at 4°C [[[[[[[[[[[for up to one month]]]]]]]]]]]]
