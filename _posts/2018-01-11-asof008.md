# Embryo asof008

There were two aims of this work:
- The first was to determine if it was possible to cut an embryo with a sliding microtome when the embryo was embedded in HM solution (STIFF GEL). 
- The second was to investigate whether DiI would travel along neurons (and remain visible) when an embryo was embedded in HM solution and the solution was then polymerised.


Embryo "asof008". Stage 26. Work with this embryo began on 08/01/18, and was completed on 22/01/18. The first aim was carried out, with the polymerised gel being cut into slices as thin as 35um. It was not possible to achieve the second aim, because the injection was not completed proficiently, and so the DiI did not travel further than the cranial nerve ganglia.


08/01/18

I removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with PBS. I removed the amniotic sac from the embryo. I then staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof008 staging features:

- digital plate was rounded (26)
- no toes/digits obviously demarcated (25?)
- maxillary process has two bumps (26)
- no evidence of bill (<27)
- pharyngeal arches overall appearance (26)

Overall, the embryo was put at a stage 26. Mfk checked and confirmed.


Asof removed the midbrain of the embryo, as well as the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof dissected until the following ganglia were exposed (embryo p.o.v.):
- VII (both sides)
- IX (both sides)
- V (both sides)

These ganglia may not have been correctly identified, since they were unconfirmed by mfk. In particular, the trigeminal ganglia may not have been correctly identified. Both trigeminal ganglia were badly damaged (the ganglion on the left (embryo's pov) was almost completely gone/destroyed).

Asof then practiced labelling all of the above ganglia with red DiI pressure injection with methanol. Instead of putting into the 37°C incubator overnight, the embryo was placed into ice cold ![HM solution (STIFF GEL)](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hm-solution-recipe.md) and kept in the cold room (4°C) for 4 days. The tube was gently shaken for the duration of the 4 days in HM solution.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI was mixed somewhat with another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


12/01/18

Asof de-gassed the tube according to the ![Hydrogel tissue embedding protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hydrogel-tissue-embedding-protocol.md) and put asof008 into the incubator at 37°C. 


15/01/18

The HM gel had polymerised when the tube was checked in the morning. This was tested by inverting the tube, and seeing that the gel did not move.


16/01/18

Asof put the embryo in a 30% sucrose solution, and this was kept for 24 hours at 4°C.

17/01/18

The polymerised HM gel containing asof008 was removed from the eppendorf tube. Mfk and asof cut asof008 with the sledge microtome (which has a freezing attachment) as follows. The HM gel containing the embryo was placed onto a drop of OCT on the microtome block and frozen at -29°C. The microtome was used to cut cross-sectional slices, first at 70um, then 50um, then 20um, then at 35um. These slices were placed into PBS (containing a drop of Triton X100), then mounted onto glass slides. These were allowed to air dry for 3 days.

22/01/18

The slides were coverslipped with 95% glycerol and visualised using a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA).
