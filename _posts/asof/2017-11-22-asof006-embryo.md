# Embryo asof006 dissection

The aim of this work was for me to practice techniques involved in the staining of an embryo.

Embryo "asof006". Stage 25.5. Work on this embryo began on 04/10/2017, and was completed on 05/10/2017. In this embryo I practiced trying to inject an embryo I had dissected to try and get the stain to take up, but could not get the staining to work.


04/10/2017 (Week 9 Wednesday)

I removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with PBS. I removed the amniotic sac from the embryo.
I then staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof006 staging features:
- Pharyngeal arches f and c were separate, e was visible as a point between ~ mid 25
- Diameter of eye was the same as the diameter of the forebrain, and less than the diameter of the midbrain ~25
- No demarcation of digits on the digital plate, digital plate pointed - 25
- No demarcation of 3rd toe in toe plate (24?), but the same of the toe plate was more like H&H 25, so - 25

Overall, asof put the embryo at stage 25. MFK checked and thought it was a bit older, around 25.5, because the f and c arches are found closer together.


Asof dissected to expose the following ganglia on both sides of the embryo:
- V
- VII
- IX

Then injected both V’s with liquid pressure injection with methanol, using red DiI. There was some contamination around the trigeminals, as indicated on the picture drawn in physical lab notebook. I tried to clear this contamination, but couldn’t remove all of it. Embryo asof006 was incubated overnight at 37.5 degrees C.

Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI was mixed somewhat with another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


05/10/2017 (Week 9 Thursday)

Embryo asof006 was taken out of the incubator after 24 hours. Asof cleared the tissue ventral to the hindbrain. Asof then put the embryo through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the file ![asof glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_posts/asof-glycerol-protocol.md). 

However, when observed under a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA), asof and MFK saw that labelling had not worked, for unknown reasons. Embryo asof006 was disposed of.
