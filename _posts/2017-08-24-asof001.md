# Embryo asof001 dissection

The aim of this work was for me to learn the process of and techniques involved in staging, dissecting, staining, processing and imaging an embryo from the beginning of the process to the end.

Embryo "asof001". Stage: 28+. Work on this embryo began on 03/08/2017, and was completed on 10/08/2017. In this embryo I was able to stain and image motor neurons in the alar plate, and took some pictures that would be useful data for my science scholars project.


03/08/2017 (Week 2 Thursday)

I removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with PBS. I removed the amniotic sac from the embryo.
I then staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof001 staging features:

- 3 digits evident
- 4 toes were demarcated
- the 3rd toe was longer than the other toes
- no 5th toe (which stopped me from putting the embryo at stage 29)

These limb features put the embryo at ~ stage 28.

- beak outgrowth visible, but earlier than stage 30 because the beak was not sqaure. This feature put the embryo at stage 28/29 (more like a 29).
- The maxilla was long, very like a stage 29.
- diameter of the left eye was less than the length of the midbrain. Staging using this eye, the embryo seemed like a 28 (this was one of the features stopping me from putting the embryo at a 29).
However, the right eye was found to be much larger than the left- the embryo was an eye mutant. The right eye was much more like a stage 29.
- midbrain and forebrain roughly the same size 
- The ventricle of the forebrain could still be seen (putting the embryo at around stage 28).

asof put the embryo at stage 28+ (i.e. a 28 with some 29 features) overall. MFK checked and agreed.


I then removed the embryo's hindbrain and the roofplate (kite shaped membrane at the posterior of the hindbrain) so that these structures would not obstruct the dissection of the hindbrain. 
Then I pinned the embryo ventral side up, and began to dissect away the pharyngeal arches.

The embryo was left in 4% pf in PB0.1M for 6 days, to keep until I next came into the lab (09/08/2017).


09/08/2017 (Week 3 Wednesday)

I continued dissecting "asof001" to look for the cranial nerve ganglia. I damaged most of these, but MFK was able to dissect out the trigeminal nerve ganglion on the left (embryo p.o.v.) side of the embryo. I used this as a guide and dissected out the trigeminal nerve ganglion on the right (embryo p.o.v.) side of the embryo. 
MFK stained the trigeminal nerves of "asof001". SPDiOC dye was used on the left (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion using crystal injection. MFK stained the right (embryo p.o.v.) trigeminal ganglion with standard DiI using pressure injection with methanol. The embryo was incubated overnight at 37.5 degrees Celcius.

Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI was mixed somewhat with another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.

DiO = SP-DiOC18(3)
Catalogue = D7778 Invitrogen
Lot = 522343

## Embryo Processing asof001:

MFK and asof prepared to image the stained hindbrain as detailed below.

The hindbrain was dissected off from the rest of the embryo, and put through a series of glycerol and prepared for imaging as detailed in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md).

MFK and asof used a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain in the hindbrain. The trigeminal nerve had taken up the stain, and so had a bit of the 8th nerve (unintentionally), and there was also a small amount of contamination.
MFK and asof took 4 pictures, as detailed below.

## Images asof001:

Picture "asof001_001" - shows migrating trigeminal nerve motor neurons, using DiI. Filter: ET-CY3.

Picture "asof001_002" - shows motor neurons in the alar plate - this image is useful data for my science scholars project. We could tell they were motor neurons because their cell bodies were visible, although they were in the alar plate, where no neuron cell bodies should be seen.
These neurons were in rostral half of the hindbrain, we couldn't see the unusually located neurons in the hindbrain caudal to the entry of the trigeminal nerve.

Picture "asof001_003" - shows a different place in the hindbrain that contains motor neurons labelled in the alar plate - this is additional useful data for my science scholars project.

Once MFK and asof had taken the pictures, we disposed of hindbrain "asof001".

As asof and MFK didnt check for contamination when the dye was injected, we are not entirely certain that the dye only stained nerves present in the trigeminal ganglia. Therefore, we cannot be entriely sure these motor neurons stained in the section aren't stained due to contamination. The reason we did not check carefully for contamination while staining asof001 was because the purpose of this dissection was for Andrea to learn the process of and techniques involved in staging, dissecting, staining, processing and imaging an embryo from the beginning of the process to the end. The primary purpose of this dissection was not to gather high quality data, so it did not matter if some contamination occurred.
