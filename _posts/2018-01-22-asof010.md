# Embryo asof010

The aim of this work was for asof to practice dissecting an embryo to maintain the skills necessary, and to generate another embryo to for cutting in cross-section.

Embryo "asof010". Stage 24 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 11/01/18, and was completed on ???????????/01/18.


11/01/18

I removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with PBS. I removed the amniotic sac from the embryo. I then staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof010 staging features:

- Wing and leg buds are longer than they are wide (24)
- No demarcation of digits of toes in wing or leg bud respectively (24)
- Overall appearance of the pharyngeal arches (24)
- Protuberances "e" and "f" are fused, and their shape is very characteristic of stage 24

Overall, the embryo was put at a stage 24 (unconfirmed).

Asof dissected to expose the following ganglia:
- V (right, embryo p.o.v.)
- VII (both sides)
- VIII (both sides)

These ganglia may have been incorrectly identified, as mfk did not check them.

Asof injected the trigeminal ganglion (right side embryo pov) and both of the vestibulocochlear ganglia. Did not inject the facial ganglia because they were too small. The embryo was placed into ice cold ![HM solution (STIFF GEL)](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hm-solution-recipe.md) and kept at 4°C for 4 days with gentle shaking.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI was mixed somewhat with another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.

Asof de-gassed the tube according to the ![Hydrogel tissue embedding protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hydrogel-tissue-embedding-protocol.md) and put embryo asof010 into the incubator at 37°C.
