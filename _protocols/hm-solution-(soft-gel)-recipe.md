# Hydrogel monomer (HM) solution recipe (SOFT GEL)

To make 5ml of Hydrogel Monomer solution (SOFT GEL), combine:

* 0.5ml (500uL) of 40% (wt/vol) acrylamide solution
* 0.125ml (125uL) of 2% (wt/vol) bisacrylamide solution
* 0.5ml (500uL) of [“10× PBS (hydrogel)”](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/10x-pbs-recipe.md)
* 2.5ml (2500uL) of 8% (wt/vol) PFA
* 1.375ml (1375uL) of distilled water
* 0.0125g (12.5mg) of VA-044 thermal initiator

Note: wt/vol = weight/volume.
Note: keep all ingredients and the reagent on ice.

Storage: store at -20°C until needed (can be stored for several weeks).

For more detailed instructions on preparation of the HM solution, refer to ![hydrogel monomer solution (SOFT GEL) preparation protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hm-solution-(soft-gel)-preparation-protocol.md).
