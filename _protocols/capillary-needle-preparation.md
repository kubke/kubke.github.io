# How to make capillary needles for liquid dye injection

Note: don't touch the part of the glass tube which will go near the filament. Grease may catch fire.

Resource(s): Kwik-Fil 100pcs Borosilicate Glass Capillaries.

1. Break glass tubes in half by hand (inside a paper towel).
2. Turn on ON/OFF switch.
3. Carefully so that the glass does not touch the filament, insert the glass tube into the machine from the top, sitting it in the groove. Tighten by turning the screw upwards.
4. Pull up bottom silver slider, until a clunk is heard.
5. Secure the bottom half of the glass tube by turning the screw upwards.
6. Pull down on slider to check that the tube is secure.

Note: The tube can move a little. Too tight, and the tube will break. Too loose at the bottom, and the slider will fall without the tube. Too loose at top and the slider will take the whole tube with it.

7. Press start.
8. Remove tubes carefully.
9. Turn off ON/OFF switch.
