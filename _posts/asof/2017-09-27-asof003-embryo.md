# Embryo asof003 dissection

The aim of this work was for me to practice, in particular, techniques involved in staining, but also to practice staging, dissecting, processing and imaging an embryo.

Embryo "asof003". Stage 25. Work on this embryo began on 12/09/2017, and was completed on 14/09/2017. In this embryo I was able to stain and image motor neurons in the alar plate, and took some pictures that would be useful data for my science scholars project, and one which I used in my Scischol 302 midterm presentation and final poster presentation.


12/09/2017 (Tuesday 2nd week of midsemester break)

I removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with PBS. I removed the amniotic sac from the embryo.
I then staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof003 staging features:

- the pharyngeal arches were around a stage 25 (f and c weren't in contact, and the point of e was obvious between them)
- maxillary process lengthened, the shape was indicative of stage 25
- diameter of eye around the same or slightly less than forebrain, less than diameter of midbrain (~ stage 25)
- digital plate distict, but no demarcation of digits, no groove between 2nd and 3rd digits (~ stage 25)
- toe plate distict, no demarcation of third toe (~ stage 24?)

Overall, asof put the embryo at stage 25. MFK checked and agreed.

Through dissection, I found and peeled out the otic vesicle on both sides of the embryo. I then exposed the following ganglia:
- auditory nerve (both sides of embryo)
- facial nerve (both sides of embryo)
- trigeminal (right side, embryo p.o.v.)

I stained all of the ganglia mentioned above with standard DiI using pressure injection with methanol. The embryo was incubated at 37.5 degrees Celcius until the morning of 14/09/2017.

Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI was mixed somewhat with another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


14/09/2017 (Thursday 2nd week of midsemester break)

I took embryo asof003 out of the incubator, and cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain, and removed the ganglia. I then put the embryo through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the file ![asof glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_posts/asof-glycerol-protocol.md).

MFK and asof used a fluorescence microscope (Model: Leica M205 FA) to visualise the stain in the hindbrain. All nerves were presumed to have taken up the stain, although it was not possible to be certain, as the neurons of cranial nerves VII and VIII are very closely associated. 

MFK and asof took 7 pictures, as detailed below.

## Images asof003:

Picture "asof003_001" - shows staining of the VII and VIII nerves (although can’t distinguish which staining is which nerve, because these are very close and the same dye was used on both) on the embryo’s left side. Both sensory (vertical processes on the edge of the hindbrain) and motor (processes projecting horizontally in a fan shape) are labelled. This image is taken using the Bright Field so we can see the rest of the hindbrain, including the floorplate.

Picture “asof003_002” - shows the same picture as asof003_001 but without Bright Field.

Picture “asof003_003” - shows motor neurons in the embryo’s left VII or VIII nerve. The cell bodies are at the tips of the fan-like processes of neurons in the basal plate, making a shape like little chain links.

Picture “asof003_004” - shows the embryo’s right V nerve, showing lots of motor neurons with their cell bodies. MFK thought the number of motor neurons present suggested that they were probably showing up due to contamination.

Picture “asof003_005” - showing nerve VII or VIII (can’t tell which) motor neuron processes crossing the floor plate (which is common in VII). They are migrating, which is known to happen.

Picture “asof003_006” - shows the sensory neurons travelling in two bundles, one tightly associated and one loosely associated, which is a well known phenomenon. It is not possible to tell which nerve these are from, as we stained with the same dye on multiple nerves, and sensory neuron projections travel the length of the hindbrain.

Picture “asof003_007” - shows a low magnification view of the whole embryo.

Once MFK and asof had taken the pictures, we disposed of hindbrain "asof003".
