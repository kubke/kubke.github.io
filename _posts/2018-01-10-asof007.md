# Embryo asof007

Embryo "asof007". Work with this embryo began on 04/01/18, and was completed on 10/01/18. The aim of this work was to attempt to cut a whole, undissected embryo embedded within the polymerised HM solution, using a vibratome. However, this was unsuccessful.

04/01/18

This embryo was placed whole into !["STIFF GEL" HM solution](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hm-solution-recipe.md) at 4°C, after this solution had been thawed from storage at -18°C. It had not been labelled with fluorescent dye, or pre-incubated in ice cold PBS, contrary to the instructions in the ![HM tissue embedding protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hydrogel-tissue-embedding-protocol.md), since this was just a test to see whether the embryo and gel could be cut by the vibratome. Embryo "asof007" was left in HM solution at 4°C for 4 days, on a rocker to provide gentle shaking.

08/01/18

Asof de-gased the tube according to the instructions in the "HM tissue embedding protocol". The tube was placed in the incubator overnight at 37°C.

09/01/18

In the morning, the HM solution in the tube had polymerised. This was tested by turning the tube upside down and observing that the solution did not move. The tube was left in the incubator out of convenience.

10/01/18

Mfk attempted to cut the gel and embryo with the vibratome, but this was unsuccessful, as the vibratome blade did not cut the gel but rather pushed it away (the gel was not stiff enough). Embryo asof007 was discarded, and it was decided that the vibratome was not a viable option for cutting the polymerised HM gel.
