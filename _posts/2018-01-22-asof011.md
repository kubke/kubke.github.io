# Embryo asof011

The aim of this work was for asof to practice dissecting an embryo to maintain the skills necessary, and to generate another embryo for cutting in cross-section.

Embryo "asof011". Stage 24 (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 15/01/18, and was completed on ???????????/01/18.

15/01/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac from the embryo. Asof then staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof011 staging features:

- Wing and leg buds are longer than they are wide (24)
- No demarcation of digits of toes in wing or leg bud respectively (24)
- Overall appearance of pharyngeal arches (24)
- Shape of protuberances "d", "e" and "f" (24)
- Pharyngeal arch made up of protuberances "d", "e" and "f"  grows over arch made up of protuberances "a", "b" and "c" (24)

Overall, the embryo was put at a stage 24 (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected to expose the following ganglia:
- V (right, embryo p.o.v.)
- VII (both sides)
- VIII (both sides)

These ganglia may have been incorrectly identified, as mfk did not check them. 

Asof injected both auditory ganglia and the trigeminal ganglion (right side, embryo p.o.v.). The embryo was placed into ice cold ![HM solution (STIFF GEL)](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hm-solution-(stiff-gel)-recipe.md) and kept at 4°C for 4 days with gentle shaking.


Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI was mixed somewhat with another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.

Asof de-gassed the tube according to the ![Hydrogel tissue embedding protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hydrogel-tissue-embedding-protocol.md) and put embryo asof011 into the incubator at 37°C. The solution polymerised, and was left in the incubator for a few days before storing at room temperature.
