# Embryo asof004 dissection

The aim of this work was for me to practice, in particular, techniques involved in staining, but also to practice staging, dissecting, processing and imaging an embryo.

Embryo "asof004". Stage 26. Work on this embryo began on 13/09/2017, and was completed on 14/09/2017. This embryo was not able to be used because I had not adequately cleared it before imaging.


13/09/2017 (Wednesday 2nd week of midsemester break)

I removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with PBS. I removed the amniotic sac from the embryo.
I then staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof004 staging features:

- Pharyngeal arches similar in shape and appearance to Hamburger & Hamilton ~ stage 26
- Diameter of eye was the same as the diameter of the the forebrain, and less than the diameter of the midbrain ~26
- 3 toes demarcated 26
- No grooves between digits ~25?
- No evidence of beak <26

Overall, asof put the embryo at a stage 26. MFK checked and agreed.


Asof dissected until the following ganglia were exposed (embryo p.o.v.):
- V (both sides)
- VII (both sides)
- VIII (right)
- IX (both sides)

Asof then practiced staining all of the above ganglia with red DiI pressure injection with methanol, and incubated overnight at 37.5 degrees C.

Details of the dyes used are below.

DiI = DiIC18(3)
Catalogue = D3911 Invitrogen
Lot = 454239
Note: this is the DiI that is spiky not granular.

The DiI was mixed somewhat with another dye: DiIC18(3).
Catalogue = D282 Invitrogen
Lot = 21522W
Note: This is the granular dye.


14/09/2017 (Thursday 2nd week of midsemester break)

I took embryo asof003 out of the incubator, and cleared tissue ventral to the hindbrain, and removed the ganglia. I then put the embryo through a series of glycerol, according to proceedure in the ![glycerol protocol](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/glycerol-protocol.md).

However, asof did not clear embryo asof004 adequately, so the neurons could not be seen under the fluorescence microscope. Additionally, the fluorescence had not been taken up well by the neurons, and there was also some contamination from the dye onto the embryo. Therefore, embryo asof004 was not useful for collecting any data from. MFK and asof took the below photographs for asof's records.

## Images asof004:

Picture "asof004_001" - shows a low magnification picture of the embryo, purely as a record of the work, but this is of no use.

Picture "asof004_002" - shows the inadequate clearing of the embryo.

Once MFK and asof had taken the pictures, hindbrain "asof004" was disposed of.
