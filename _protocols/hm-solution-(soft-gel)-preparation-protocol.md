# Protocol for preparing 5ml HM solution (SOFT gel)


| Amount	| Reagent	|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 0.5ml (500uL) | 40% (wt/vol) acrylamide solution |
| 0.125ml (125uL) | 2% (wt/vol) bisacrylamide solution |
| 0.5ml (500uL) | ![“10× PBS (hydrogel)”](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/10x-pbs-recipe.md) |
| 2.5ml (2500uL) | 8% (wt/vol) PFA |
| 1.375ml (1375uL) | distilled water |
| 0.0125g (12.5mg) | VA-044 thermal initiator |

## Preparation of HM solution:

1. Turn on the fume hood.

2. Collect ice bucket, 5ml test tube, 200uL pipette and 1000uL pipette, and place into the fume hood.

3. Take the 40% acrylamide solution from the fridge to the fume hood before opening the bottle. Pipette 500uL of acrylamide solution into a 5ml test tube using a 1000uL pipette. Place the 5ml test tube into the bucket of ice. Return the acrylamide solution to the fridge.

4. Take the 2% bisacrylamide solution from the fridge to the fume hood before opening the bottle. Pipette 125uL of bisacrylamide solution into the 5ml test tube (using a 200uL pipette). Mix the solutions and place the tube into the bucket of ice. Return the bisacrylamide solution to the fridge.

5. Take the “10× PBS (hydrogel)” solution from the fridge to the fume hood. Pipette 500uL of PBS into the 5ml test tube. Mix the solutions and place the tube into the bucket of ice. Return the “10× PBS (hydrogel)” solution to the fridge.

6. Take the 8% PFA solution from the fridge to the fume hood before opening the bottle. Pipette 2500uL of PFA into the 5ml test tube. Mix the solutions and place the tube into the bucket of ice. Return the 8% PFA solution to the fridge.

7. Take the distilled water from the fridge to the fume hood. Pipette 1375uL water from the bottle into the 5ml test tube. Mix the solutions and place the tube into the bucket of ice. Return the distilled water to the fridge.

8. Weigh out 0.0125g of VA-044 thermal initiator and add to the 5ml test tube. Mix the solutions and place the tube into the bucket of ice.

9. Pipette 1ml aliquots into 5 eppendorf tubes. Store at -20°C.
