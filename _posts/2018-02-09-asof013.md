# Embryo asof013

The aim of this work was to test a longer embedding period to determine if this will give better penetration of the gel into the tissue of the embryo.

Embryo "asof012". Stage 25+ (unconfirmed). Work with this embryo began on 01/02/18, and was completed on ?????????/01/18.

01/02/18

Asof removed the embryo from 4% pf in PB 0.1M solution, and covered the embryo with PBS. Asof removed the amniotic sac from the embryo. Asof then staged the embryo according to Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992. The features used to stage the embryo are described below.

## asof012 staging features:

- The point of protuberance "e" can be seen between protuberances "c" and "f" of the pharyngeal arches (~25)
- Overall appearance of the maxillary process and the place where the future bill will be (~26)
- At least 2 toes are demarcated in the toe plate (early 26)
- No digits are exident in the digital plate (early 26)

Overall, the embryo was put at a stage 25+ (unconfirmed).

Asof removed the midbrain and the roof plate of the hindbrain. Asof then dissected and peeled out the otic vesicles to expose the following ganglia:
- V (both sides)
- VII (both sides)
- VIII (right, embryo p.o.v.)

These ganglia may have been incorrectly identified, as mfk did not check them. There were only remnants of the vesitubulocochlear ganglion, because it was damaged by asof's dissection. Asof also dissected off too much tissue ventral to the surface of the hinbrain, so there was a higher possibility of contamination during the labelling process.

Asof injected both trigeminal ganglia with red DiI pressure injection with methanol. The embryo was incubated overnight at 37°C in PBS.

02/02/18

Asof checked the embryo under the fluorescence microscope, and found that contamination was present in  many places all over the embryo. However, since the primary purpose of asof013 was to test the HM solution penetration with a longer embedding period, asof013 was placed into ice cold ![HM solution (STIFF GEL)](https://github.com/ansoffe/kubke.github.io/blob/master/_protocols/hm-solution-recipe.md) and kept at 4°C for 10 days with gentle shaking.
